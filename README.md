Since the google code archive source is really messy, I decided to fork a "github-ified" version which makes it much easier to work
with, especially to a newbie like me.

The last time this was updated was on Mar 26, 2010, and hasn't really been updated until then so of course it doesn't readily
compile. As far as I can tell, the app uses a custom library called "libcard" which needs to be built before anything else.
The only exception is woodsec, which according to the creator is a "tool to manipulate secure area."

There actually has been a patch made to support libnds 1.4.8 on Mar 19, 2016, and will be tested to see if it fixes any issues that
have arisen over the years, but even that's outdated as the current version is libnds 1.7.3-3 as of Aug 22, 2019.
